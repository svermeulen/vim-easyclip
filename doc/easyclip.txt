INTRODUCTION                                    *easyclip-introduction*

EasyClip is a plugin for Vim which contains a collection of clipboard related
functionality with the goal of making using Vim simpler and more intuitive
without losing any of its power.

A good starting point for the motivation behind this plugin can be found in Drew
Neil's post: 
Registers: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Parts
(http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/11/registers-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-parts/)

The most recent version of this plugin can be found at
https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-easyclip

INSTALLATION                                    *easyclip-installation*

I recommend loading your plugins with neobundle
(https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) or vundle
(https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) or pathogen
(https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

This plugin also requires that you have Tim Pope's repeat.vim
(https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat) plugin installed.

BLACK HOLE REDIRECTION                          *easyclip-cut*

By default, Vim's built-in delete operator will yank the deleted text in 
addition to just deleting it.  This works great when you want to cut text and 
paste it somewhere else, but in many other cases it can make things more 
difficult.  For example, if you want to make some tiny edit to fix formatting 
after cutting some text, you either have to have had the foresight to use a 
named register, or specify the black hole register explicitly to do your 
formatting.  This plugin solves that problem by redirecting all change and 
delete operations to the black hole register and introducing a new operator, '
cut' (by default this is mapped to the `m` key for 'move').

There is simply no need to clutter up the yank history with every single edit, 
when you almost always know at the time you are deleting text whether it's 
something that is worth keeping around or not.

**NOTE** As a result of the above, by default easyclip will shadow an import 
vim function: The Add Mark key (`m`).  Therefore either you will want to use a 
different key for the 'cut' operator (see options section below for this) or 
remap something else to 'add mark'.  For example, to use `gm` for 'add mark' 
instead of `m`, include the following in your vimrc:

    nnoremap gm m

SUBSTITUTION OPERATOR                           *easyclip-substitute*

Because replacing text is such a common operation, EasyClip includes a motion 
for it.  It is essentially equivalent to doing a change operation then pasting 
using the specified register.  For example, assuming you have mapped this 
motion to the `s` key, to paste over the word under the cursor you would type `
siw`, or to paste inside brackets, `si(`, etc.

It can also take a register to use for the substitution (eg. `"asip`), and is 
fully repeatable using the `.` key.

**NOTE** This feature is off by default.  To use, you have to either enable 
the option |g:EasyClipUseSubstituteDefaults| (in which case it will be mapped 
to the `s` key) or map the key/keys of your choice to the `<plug>` 
mappings found in substitute.vim.

YANK BUFFER                                     *easyclip-yankbuffer*

EasyClip allows you to yank and cut things without worrying about losing text 
that you copied previously.  It achieves this by storing all yanks into a 
buffer, which you can cycle through forward or backwards to choose the yank 
that you want

This works very similar to the way YankRing (https://github.com/vim-scripts/
YankRing.vim) and YankStack (https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/vim-yankstack) 
work, in that you can use a key binding to toggle between different yanks 
immediately after triggering a paste or substitute.  (Most of the 
functionality is actually taken and adapted from Yankstack, with changes to 
make it work with substitute)

By default, the keys to toggle the paste are mapped to `<c-n>` and `<c-p>` (
similar to yankring).  For example, executing `p<c-p>` will paste, then toggle 
it to the most recent yank before that.  You can continue toggling forwards/
backwards in the yank history to replace the most recent paste as much as you 
want.  Note that the toggle action will of course not be included in the undo 
history.  That is, pressing undo after any number of swaps will undo the paste 
and not each swap.

This method of toggling the chosen yank after paste will probably be your 
primary method of digging back into the yank buffer.  Note that in this case 
the yank buffer is unchanged.  What this means for example is that you can 
toggle a given paste back using `<c-p>` 10 times, then if you perform a new 
paste in a different location it will still use the most recent yank (and not 
the final yank you arrived at after 10 swaps).

Alternatively, you can execute keys `[y` or `]y` to navigate the yank buffer
'head' forwards or backwards. In this case the change will be permanent.
That is, pressing `[y[yp` will paste the third most recent yank.  
Subsequent pastes will use the same yank, until you go forwards again using `]y`.

The [y and ]y mappings are not on by default (map them manually).

You can view the full list of yanks at any time by running the command `:Yanks`

Note that you can swap substitution operations in the same way as paste.

Every time the yank buffer changes, it also populates all the numbered 
registers.  `"1` is therefore the previous yank, `"2` is the yank before that, 
etc.  This is similar to how the numbered registers work by default (but a bit 
more sane).  (Credit to Drew Neil for the suggestion)

Also, see |g:EasyClipPreserveCursorPositionAfterYank| option below for an 
optional non standard customization to yank

PASTE                                           *easyclip-paste*

By default EasyClip preserves the default vim paste behaviour, which is the 
following:

*  `p` (lowercase) pastes text after the current line if the pasted text is 
    multiline (or after the current character if non-multiline)
*  `P` (uppercase) behaves the same except acts before the current line (or 
    before the current character if non-multiline)

When the text is multi-line, the cursor is placed at the start of the new text.
When the paste is non-multiline, the cursor is placed at the end.

Alternatively, you can enable the option 
|g:EasyClipAlwaysMoveCursorToEndOfPaste| to have the cursor positioned at the 
end in both cases (off by default).  Note that when this option is enabled, 
the beginning of the multi-line text is added to the jumplist, so you can 
still return to the start of the paste by pressing `<c-o>` (and this applies 
to multi-line substitutions as well)

Another non-standard option is |g:EasyClipAutoFormat| (off by default), which 
will automatically format text immediately after it is pasted.  This can be 
useful when pasting text from one indent level to another.

Easy Clip also includes a mapping for insert mode paste, which automatically 
turns on 'paste' mode for the duration of the paste.  Using 'paste' mode will 
work much more intuitively when pasting text with multiple lines while in 
insert mode.  You can enable this by including something similar to the 
following in your .vimrc:

    imap <c-v> <plug>EasyClipInsertModePaste

For convenience, there is also a plug for command mode paste, which you can 
enable with the following:

    cmap <c-v> <plug>EasyClipCommandModePaste

SHARED YANK HISTORY                             *easyclip-shared-yank-history*

EasyClip can automatically store the yank history to file, so that it can be 
restored the next time you start Vim.  Storing it to file also allows other 
active Vim instances to seamlessly share the same clipboard and yank history.

You can enable this feature by enabling the option |g:EasyClipShareYanks| 
(NOTE: off by default).  You can also customize where the yank history file 
gets stored (see options section below)

CLIPBOARD SETTING                               *easyclip-clipboard-setting*

Vim's built-in setting for |clipboard| can be set to one of the following:

1. set clipboard=
1. set clipboard=unnamed
1. set clipboard=unnamed,unnamedplus
1. set clipboard=unnamedplus

Leaving it as (1) which is Vim's default, will cause all yank/delete/paste 
operations to use the `"` register.  The only drawback here is that whenever 
you want to copy/paste something from another application, you have to 
explicitly access the system clipboard, which is represented by the `*` 
register.  For example, to copy the current line to the system clipboard, you 
would type `"*yy`.  And to paste some text copied from another window, you 
would type `"*p`

To avoid this extra work, you can use option (2) and set it to `unnamed`.  
This will cause all yank/delete/paste operations to use the system register 
`*`.  This way, you can copy something in Vim then immediately paste it into 
another application.  And vice versa when returning to vim.

I recommend using one of these two options.  I personally use option (2).

When option (3) is enabled, both Vim and EasyClip will use the `+` register as 
its default.

Option (4) is the same as option (3), except Vim will also automatically copy 
the contents of the `+` register to the `*` register.

OPTIONS                                         *easyclip-options*

EasyClip can be easily customized to whatever mapping you wish, using the
following options:

*g:EasyClipAutoFormat*        Default: 0.  Set this to 1 to enable
auto-formatting.  This can be useful when pasting text from one indent level to
another.

*g:EasyClipYankHistorySize*   Default: 50. Change this to limit yank history

*g:EasyClipCopyExplicitRegisterToDefault*    Default: 0.  When set to 0, easy-clip will not change the default register clipboard when an explicit register is given.  For example, when set to 0, if you type `"ayip` it will copy the current paragraph to the `a` register, but it will not affect the default register, so typing `p` will work the same as it did before the above command.  When set to 1, typing `"ayip` will copy the paragraph to both.

*g:EasyClipAlwaysMoveCursorToEndOfPaste*    Default: 0.  Set this to 1 to always
position cursor at the end of the pasted text for both multi-line and
non-multiline pastes.

*g:EasyClipPreserveCursorPositionAfterYank* - Default 0 (ie. disabled).  Vim's
default behaviour is to position the cursor at the beginning of the yanked text,
which is consistent with other motions.  However if you prefer the
cursor position to remain unchanged when performing yanks, enable this
option.

*g:EasyClipShareYanks* - Default: 0 (ie. disabled). When enabled, yank history 
is saved to file, which allows other concurrent Vim instances to automatically 
share the yank history, and also allows yank history to be automatically 
restored when restarting vim.

*g:EasyClipShareYanksFile* - Default: '.easyclip'. The name of the file to 
save the yank history to when |g:EasyClipShareYanks| is enabled.

*g:EasyClipShareYanksDirectory* - Default: '$HOME'. The directory to use to 
store the file with name given by |g:EasyClipShareYanksFile| setting.  Only 
applicable when |g:EasyClipShareYanks| option is enabled.

*g:EasyClipShowYanksWidth* - Default: 80 - The width to display for each line 
when the `Yanks` command is executed

*g:EasyClipSwapPasteForwardFallback* - Default: undefined. If set, and the
previous action was not a paste <Plug>EasyClipSwapPasteForward will exec
this. Useful if you have muscle memory for a previous use of <c-p>.

*g:EasyClipSwapPasteBackwardsFallback* - Default: undefined. If set, and the
previous action was not a paste <Plug>EasyClipSwapPasteBackwards will exec
this. Useful if you have muscle memory for a previous use of <c-n>.

You can also disable the default mappings by setting one or more of the
following to zero.  By default they are set to 1 (ie. enabled)

    *g:EasyClipUseYankDefaults*

    *g:EasyClipUseCutDefaults*

    *g:EasyClipUsePasteDefaults*

    *g:EasyClipEnableBlackHoleRedirect*

    *g:EasyClipUsePasteToggleDefaults*

One exception to the above is substitute, which is 0 by default (ie. disabled)

    *g:EasyClipUseSubstituteDefaults*

To change from the default mappings, you can disable one of the options above
and then map to the specific <plug> mappings of your choice.  For example, to
change the mapping for cut (by default set to `m`) to `x`, include the following
in your vimrc:`

    let g:EasyClipUseCutDefaults = 0

    nmap x <Plug>MoveMotionPlug xmap x <Plug>MoveMotionXPlug nmap xx
    <Plug>MoveMotionLinePlug

Or to change the bindings for toggling paste from '<c-n>' and '<c-p>' to '<c-d>'
and '<c-f>' include the following:

    let g:EasyClipUsePasteToggleDefaults = 0

    nmap <c-f> <plug>EasyClipSwapPasteForward nmap <c-d>
    <plug>EasyClipSwapPasteBackwards

Or to use 'gs' for substitute include the following:  (in this case you don't
need to turn off the default since the default is already disabled)

    nmap <silent> gs <plug>SubstituteOverMotionMap nmap gss <plug>SubstituteLine
    xmap gs <plug>XEasyClipPaste

For reference, or other kinds of mappings, see the bottom of the file with the
name of the operation you wish to remap (vim-easy-clip/autoload/substitute.vim /
move.vim / yank.vim /etc.)

Note that EasyClip will only enable a default mapping if it hasn't already been
mapped to something in your .vimrc.

KEY MAPPINGS                                    *easyclip-mappings*

*dd* - Delete the line and *do not* change clipboard

*D* - Delete from cursor to the end of the line and *do not* change clipboard

*dD* - Delete the contents of line except the newline character (that is, make it blank) and *do not* change clipboard

*x* - Delete the character under cursor and *do not* change clipboard

*s* - Delete the character under cursor then enter insert mode and *do not* change clipboard

*P* - Same as p except inserts text before current line/character

*<leader>p* - Same as 'p' except does not auto-format text.  This is only relevant if the auto-format option is enabled

*<leader>P* - Same as 'P' except does not auto-format text. This is only relevant if the auto-format option is enabled

*gp* - Same as p but preserves the current cursor position

*gP* - Same as P but preserves the current cursor position

*g<leader>P* - Same as '<leader>P' but preserves the current cursor position

*g<leader>p* - Same as '<leader>p' but preserves the current cursor position

*m* <motion> - Delete over the given motion and copy text to clipboard

*mm* - Delete the current line and copy text to clipboard

*<c-p>* -p>' - Rotate the previous paste forward in yank buffer.  Note that this binding will only work if executed immediately after a paste

*<c-n>* -n>' - Rotate the previous paste backward in yank buffer.  Note that this binding will only work if executed immediately after a paste

*Y* - Copy text from cursor position to the end of line to the clipboard

When the option |g:EasyClipUseSubstituteDefaults| is enabled, the following mappings are added:

s<motion> - Substitute over the given motion with specified register (or default register if unspecified).

ss - Substitute over the current line with specified register (or default register if unspecified).

gs - Same as s but preserves the current cursor position.

CUSTOM YANKS                                        *easyclip-custom-yanks*

If you have custom yanks that occur in your vimrc or elsewhere and would like 
them to be included in the yank history, you should call the EasyClip#Yank().  
For example, to add a binding to yank the current file name you could add the 
following to your .vimrc:

    nnoremap <leader>yf :call EasyClip#Yank(expand('%'))<cr>

Another way to do the above (which is necessary if you don't control the yank 
yourself), is to do the following:

    nnoremap <leader>yf :EasyClipBeforeYank<cr>:let @*=expand('%')<cr>:EasyClipOnYanksChanged<cr>
