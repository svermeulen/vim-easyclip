INTRODUCTION                                    *easyclip-introduction*

[EasyClip.vim](https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-easyclip) is a collection of 
clipboard related functionality with the goal of making using vim simpler 
without losing any of its power.
(https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-easyclip)

INSTALLATION                                    *easyclip-installation*

I recommend loading your plugins with either Pathogen 
(https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) or Vundle 
(https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) (I personally prefer Vundle).

BLACK HOLE REDIRECTION                          *easyclip-cut*

By default, Vim's built-in delete operator will yank the deleted text in 
addition to just deleting it.  This works great when you want to cut text and 
paste it somewhere else, but in many other cases it can make things more 
difficult.  For example, if you want to do some tiny edit to fix formatting 
after cutting some text, you either have to have had the foresight to use a 
named register, or specify the black hole register explicitly to do your 
formatting, both of which seem overly cumbersome.  This plugin solves that 
problem by redirecting all change and delete operations to the black hole 
register and introducing a new operator, cut (by default mapped to the 'm' 
 key, for 'move'). For example, to cut the word under cursor using the default 
bindings you would type 'miw'. 

There is simply no need to clutter up the yank history with every single edit, 
when you almost always know at the time you are deleting text whether it's 
something that is worth keeping around or not.

SUBSTITUTION OPERATOR                           *easyclip-substitute*

Because replacing text is such a common operation, this plugin includes a motion
for it (by default mapped to 's' key, for 'substitute').  It is essentially 
equivalent to doing a change operation then pasting using the specified register. 
For example, to paste over the word under the cursor you would type siw.

YANK BUFFER                                     *easyclip-yankbuffer*

Easyclip allows you to yank and cut things without worrying about losing text 
that you copied previously.  It achieves this by storing all yanks into a buffer,
which you can cycle through forward or backwards to choose the yank that you 
want.  (By default, cycle backward using [y and cycle forward using ]y).  

The first line of the currently selected yank will be displayed in the status 
line.

Note: Most of the yank functionality is shamelessly stolen and adapted from 
the great yankstack plugin, which can be found here 
(https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/vim-yankstack)

PASTE                                           *easyclip-paste*

Easy clip makes the following changes to Vim's default paste
- Adds previously position to jump list
    - This allows you to easily return to the position the cursor was before 
pasting by pressing <c-o>
    - Note that the substitute operator also adds previous position to the 
jumplist, so you can hit <c-o> in that case to return to previous position
as well
- Auto formats pasted text
    - Also automatically corrects the `[ and `] marks according to the 
formatted text
- p and P behaviour
    - Always positions the cursor directly after the pasted text
    - P pastes text after the current line if multiline (or after the current 
character if non-multiline)
    - P behaves the same except acts before the current line (or before the 
current character)
- gp and gP behaviour
    - Same as p and P except the cursor does not move
    - Note there is a similar operator (gs / gS) for the substitute operator
- <c-p> behaviour
    - When the autoformat option is on, c-p can be used in place of p 
to paste without any formatting applied

SYSTEM CLIPBOARD SYNC                           *easyclip-ossync*

Easyclip will also automatically sync with your system clipboard.

Every time you leave and return to vim, easy clip will check whether you copied
anything from outside Vim and add it to the yank history.

OPTIONS                                         *easyclip-options*

            *g:EasyClipAutoFormat*
g:EasyClipAutoFormat        Set this to 0 to disable auto-formatting pasting text

            *g:EasyClipYankHistorySize*
g:EasyClipYankHistorySize   Change this to limit yank history, defaults to 30

KEY MAPPINGS                                    *easyclip-mappings*

*s*
s<motion>       Substitute specified text with specified register

*ss*
ss              Substitute current line with specified register

*S*
S               Substitute to end of line, similar to C/D/Y

*gs*
gs/gS           Same as s/S but preserves the current cursor position

*sS*
sS              Substitute current line with specified register, except the 
newline character

*p*
p               Paste from specified register. Inserts after current line if 
text is multiline, after current character if text is non-multiline.  Leaves 
cursor at end of pasted text.

*P*
P               Same as p except inserts text before current line/character

*gp* *gP*
gp/gP           Same as p/P but preserves the current cursor position

*m*
m<motion>       Cut operator

*M*
M               Cut to end of line

*mm*
mm              Cut line

*mM*
mM              Cut line but except newline

*[y*
[y              Go backward in the yank buffer

*]y*
]y              Go forward in the yank buffer

*yd*
yd              Display contents of yank buffer

*Y*
Y               Yank to end of line

CONFIGURATION                                       *easyclip-configuration*

If you want to load easyclip without defining any of the default key
mappings, just add >

   let g:EasyClipUseDefaults = 0

to your |.vimrc| file.

The other option that you can use is 'g:EasyClipYankHistorySize' which
controls, as you might guess, the number of yanks to keep in memory at any
one time.

DISCLAIMER                                      *easyclip-disclaimer*

This plugin is very new and as such most certainly contains bugs.  Feedback and 
contributions welcome!

TODO                                            *easyclip-todo*

- Add back ability to toggle most recent paste between pastes after pasting, 
similar to yankstack/yankring - yd should open up the list of yanks in a 
scratch buffer so that it is searchable
